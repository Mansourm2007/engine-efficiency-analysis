# engine-efficiency-analysis
Basic code example from the STEM coding competition.

This is a basic Python program I wrote during the STEM competition that took place in Year 13. I didn't take computer science that year so that code was all from my skills from Year 12 as I hadn't practiced any coding since. This was written without reference material or recent coding experience.

# Disclaimer
While this isnt AI-related, I included it to show that I have experience in programming(Python primarily), to show that I can think logically about data conditions, work with arrays, loops and conditions.

# What It Does

The program analyzes a set of engine performance data (temperature, RPM, and fuel usage) across five samples. It then places these values between 3 categories: Efficient, Overloaded, and Normal. It also provides the average of each variable and how many samples were Efficient, Overloaded, and Normal.
